# Rust-RPG-Test
A text based RPG made in rust

I am currently learing rust, and this is one f the projects i think that i will be working of for some longer time, so i am makeing a git repo.

## How to use:
Once you start the program, it will start a shell, enter "?" to see the different commands and how to use them.
This is currently how the program works, for debug purposes. Later this will probably not be possible
