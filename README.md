# Rust-RPG-Test
A text based RPG made in rust

I am currently learing rust, and this is one f the projects i think that i will be working of for some longer time, so i am makeing a git repo.

## How to use:
Once you start the program, it will start a shell, enter "?" to see the different commands and how to use them.
This is currently how the program works, for debug purposes. Later this will probably not be possible.

If you want to try the main features, go into the opt.ini file, and set the debug parameter to 0.
If the program closes right on startup, that will mean that there is no loop there.
